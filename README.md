# simon-game
A simple memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my web development learning journey.

ðŸ§  How It Works:
- The game displays a sequence of colors.
- Your task is to repeat the sequence in the correct order.
- Each level adds a new color to the sequence, increasing the challenge.
- The game ends when you make a mistake!

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
- HTML â€“ Structure of the game elements
- CSS â€“ Styling and animations
- JavaScript â€“ Game logic and interactivity

ðŸš€ What I Learned:
- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners and handling user input
- Basic game loops and logic
- Working with arrays and timeouts
